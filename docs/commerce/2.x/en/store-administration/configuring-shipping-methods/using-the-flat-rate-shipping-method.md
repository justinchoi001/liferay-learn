# Using the Flat Rate Shipping Method

Buyers can choose a flat rate shipping option to ship any product. By creating multiple flat rate options, you can give customers choices of cost, speed, or security.

Flat rate shipping imposes the same cost on every product in the catalog. You can create exceptions, however, for individual products from the _Shipping Extra Price_ field in the product’s [Configuration](../../managing-a-catalog/managing-inventory/product-inventory-configuration-reference.md) tab.

By default, the Flat Rate shipping method is enabled.

To add a new Flat Rate Shipping Option:

1. Navigate to the _Control Panel_ &rarr; _Commerce_ &rarr; _Channels_.

1. Scroll down to _Shipment Methods_.
