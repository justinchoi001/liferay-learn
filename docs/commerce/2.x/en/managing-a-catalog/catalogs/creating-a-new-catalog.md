1. Click _Catalogs_.

    ![Navigate to the Catalogs in the Commerce section.](./creating-a-new-catalog/images/03.png)

1. Click the Add (![Add icon](../../images/icon-add.png)) button to add a new catalog.
1. Enter the following:

    * **Name**: Medical Supplies
    * **Default Catalog Language**: (your Language) (for example, _English (United States)_)
    * **Currency**: (your store's currency) (_US Dollar_)

    ![Add a new blank Catalog.](./creating-a-new-catalog/images/04.png)

1. Click _Submit_ when finished.

The new catalog has been created.
