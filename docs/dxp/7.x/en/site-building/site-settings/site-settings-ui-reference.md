# Site Settings UI Reference

Liferay DXP is built with flexibility in mind. Beyond just creating content and pages, Liferay DXP has a wealth of configuration options and tools available to help you create the site that meets your needs and the needs of your users.

The Site Settings UI is organized into four tabs:

* [General](#general)
* [Social](#social)
* [Language](#language)
* [Advanced](#advanced)

To view Site Settings, open the *Product Menu* and go to *Configuration* &rarr; *Settings*.

![Site Settings are organized into four tabs.](./site-settings-ui-reference/images/05.png)

## General

General settings range from core configuration, like a site's Membership Type, to finer details like Documents and Media indexing options. The tab's content is organized into the following subsections: Details, Pages, Categorization, Site URL, Documents and Media, Open Graph, Asset Auto Tagging, Sharing, and Custom Fields.

### Details

**Site ID**: A *Site ID* is a unique number automatically generated for a site at its creation. This ID is permanent and cannot be changed.

**Name**: Set a site's title using the *Name* field. This title is displayed in the browserâ€™s title bar as well as the header for each site page. You can also localize a site's name via the *Language Flag* button. See [Modifying Localizable Site Fields](./configuring-site-languages/modifying-localizable-site-fields.md) for more information.

**Description**: Use the *Description* field to explain a site's purpose. You can also localize a site's description via the *Language Flag* button. See [Modifying Localizable Site Fields](./configuring-site-languages/modifying-localizable-site-fields.md) for more information.

**Active**: Determine whether a site is *Active* or *Inactive*. While inactive, a site is inaccessible to users, though it can be reactivated if desired.

**Membership Type**: Select a *Membership Type* to determine how restrictive a site's membership is. See [Changing Site Membership Types](./site-users/changing-site-membership-type.md) for more information.

**Allow Manual Membership Management**: Determine whether to allow members to be manually added or removed from a site. If your site's membership is handled automatically by a membership policy, you can disable this setting. See [Managing Membership Policies for Sites](./site-users/changing-site-membership-type.md) for more information.

**Parent Site**: Designate a site as a child site by selecting its parent site. See [Site Hierarchies](../building-sites/site-hierarchies.md) for more information.

**Limit Membership to Parent Site Members**: Determine whether a child site's membership is limited to members of its parent site.

### Pages

In the *Pages* section, you can view a site's Public and Private pages, if any exist. If they don't exist, a *Site Templates* selector appears for creating pages with a Site Template.

![You can select a Site Template for your Public and Private Pages if they're not already configured.](./site-settings-ui-reference/images/01.png)

### Categorization

In the *Categorization* section, you can categorize site content using *Topics* and *Tags*. These tools help organize sites so users can more easily find your site's content via search and navigation widgets. For more information on using tags and categories, see [Organizing Content with Tags and Categories](https://help.liferay.com/hc/articles/360028820452-Organizing-Content-with-Tags-and-Categories).

### Site URL

**Friendly URL**: Set a custom URL that is used for both public and private site pages. See [Configuring Your Site's Friendly URL](./managing-site-urls/configuring-your-sites-friendly-url.md) for more information.

**Public and Private Virtual Host**: Set public and private *Virtual Hosts* to map to a site's public and private pages. See [Configuring Virtual Hosts Site URLs](./managing-site-urls/configuring-virtual-hosts-site-urls.md) for more information.

![You can configure virtual hosts for your Sites.](./site-settings-ui-reference/images/02.png)

### Documents and Media

In the *Documents and Media* section, you can determine whether to enable *Directory Indexing*. When enabled, a user with view permission can browse the site's document library files and folders.

### Site Template

If you created your site using a *Site Template*, this section identifies your selected template and whether the template allows users to modify pages that inherit it. See [Building Sites from Templates](../building-sites/building-sites-with-site-templates.md) for more information about site templates and how to create your own.

### Open Graph

```note::
   Available in Liferay 7.3+
```

**Enable Open Graph**: Determine whether to embed [Open Graph](https://ogp.me/) `<meta>` tags in the `<head>` of your site's pages. These tags define page metadata to create engaging representations of your site's content when shared in applications that support the Open Graph protocol, such as Facebook, Slack, and Twitter.

**Open Graph Image**: Use the *Image* and *Alt Description* fields to define the default `og:image` and `og:image:alt` properties used by your site's pages. You can also localize the image's alt description via the *Language Flag* button. See [Configuring Open Graph](./configuring-open-graph.md) to learn more.

### Asset Auto Tagging

In the *Asset Auto Tagging* section, you can enable or disable asset auto tagging on this site. When enabled, assets will be auto tagged by the providers configured at instance level. See [Asset Auto Tagging]() for more information. <!--FIX link-->

### Sharing

With these fields, you can set page metadata, such as author, date of creation, and geolocation. This section only appears once you've configured custom fields for your site.

Geolocalized assets can be displayed for documents, web content articles, DDL records, and more.

### Recycle Bin

In the *Recycle Bin* section, you can determine whether the *Recycle Bin* is enabled and specify the number of minutes an asset remains in the Recycle Bin before being automatically deleted. See [Configuring the Asset Recycle Bin for Sites](./site-content-configurations/configuring-the-asset-recycle-bin-for-sites.md) for more information.

### Content Sharing
