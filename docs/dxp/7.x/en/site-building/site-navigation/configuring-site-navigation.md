# Configuring Site Navigation

There are multiple ways in DXP to configure Site Navigation; you can leverage the _Navigation Menu_ application and widget, use a Page Tree, or add and manage Collections.

## Using Site Builder

Beginning in 7.3, the default home page is a Content Page; previously it was a Widget page.

## Managing Pages

New pages are created on the _Site Builder_ &rarr; _Pages_ page in _Site Administration_. Pages can be created as _Public Pages_ which anyone can view, or _Private Pages_ which can only be viewed by Site Members. See [Adding a Page to a Site](../creating-pages/adding-pages/adding-a-page-to-a-site.md) to learn how to add a page.

## Using Navigation Menus

See [Using Navigation Menus](./using-navigation-menus.md) to learn how to create Navigation Menus and deploy them on a Site page. See the [Navigation Menu Widget Reference](./navigation-menu-widget-reference.md) to learn more about how to configure the _Navigation Menu_ widget.

## Using the Page Tree

Users can view and configure the pages in each Site in a vertical hierarchy.

To access the Page Tree:

1. Navigate to the your Site's _Site Administration_.
1. Click _Page Tree_.

    ![The Page Tree function is located in the Site Administration.](./configuring-site-navigation/images/02.png)

1. The left menu displays the Site's pages and child pages:

    ![View each Site's Page Tree.](./configuring-site-navigation/images/03.png)

In the Page Tree view, users can still add more pages or more child pages, configure a page, and toggle between Public and Private Pages.

## Using Collections

See [Understanding Collections](../content-authoring-and-management/collections/user-guide/README.rst) to learn more about Collections and how to create them.
