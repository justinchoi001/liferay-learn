# Content Recommendations

> Subscribers

A site's content generates clicks from users. For example, if someone visits a sporting goods store's site and clicks on several hunting promotional ads, you can deduce an interest in hunting products and can promote this type of content when this user visits the site again. To do this, you need an infrastructure that tracks user views and displays the appropriate content based on behavior. You can accomplish this with _Content Recommendations_. (The alternative is to use Segments but those track perceived audiences and not user behavior.)

This is done by adding tags to content or Site Pages and monitoring the users who visit them. When a user views a specific content type or Page, its tags are attached to that user as _interests_. When the user visits other pages, content that matches their interests is displayed to them.

## Monitoring Recommendations

 The monitoring process is facilitated by [Analytics Cloud](https://learn.liferay.com/analytics-cloud/latest/en/getting-started/quick-tour/welcome-to-analytics-cloud.html), so you must have your DXP instance synced with it. If you haven't done this yet, start by [adding your DXP instance as a data source](https://learn.liferay.com/analytics-cloud/latest/en/getting-started/connecting-data-sources/connecting-liferay-dxp-using-oauth.html).

Once your DXP instance is synced with Analytics Cloud and you're leveraging Content Recommendation, a user's interests are viewable by navigating to the _Analytics Cloud_'s left menu &rarr; *Individuals* &rarr; *Interests*.

## Recommending DXP Content

To begin recommending content to users, users must

* Add tags to content or Pages. For demonstration purposes, we will use a web content article.
* Display content based on user behavior.

### Creating a Display Template to View Recommended Content

For demonstration purposes, we also will create a _Display Page Template_ that is used specifically to view the web content article. To create a new Display Template:

1. Navigate to the _Site Administration_ &rarr; _Site Builder_ &rarr; _Page Templates_.

    ![Navigate to Page Templates to create a new Display Page Template](./content-recommendations/images/02.png)

1. Click the _Display Page Templates_ tab.
1. Click the _Add_ button (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)).
1. Enter a name: _Recommended WC Template_.
1. Select _Web Content Article_ content type/
1. Select _Basic Web Content_ for the subtype.

    ![Create a new Display Page Template](./content-recommendations/images/03.png)

1. Click _Save_.

### Configure the Fragment on the Display Page Template

Once the Display Template has been created, users must configure the template by mapping it to the web content article.

1. Click the _Fragments and Widgets_ button.
1. Drag the _Paragraph_ Fragment to the page.

    ![Add the paragraph fragment to the page.](./content-recommendations/images/04.png)

1. Click the _Map_ button and select _Basic Web Content_ for its Source and Field.

    ![Map the fragment to the Web Content article.](./content-recommendations/images/05.png)

1. Click _Publish_ when finished.

## Creating Content Recommendations Using a Web Content Article

Once the new Display Template has been created, we will create a [web content Article](../../../content-authoring-and-management/web-content/user-guide/web-content-articles/adding-a-basic-web-content-article.md).

1. Navigate to the _Site Adminstration_ &rarr; _Content & Data_ &rarr; _Web Content_.
1. Click the _Add_ button (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) &rarr; _Basic Web Content_.
1. Enter a name for the article.
1. Enter some content for the article.
1. In the _Properties_ menu on the right, expand the _Display Page Template_ section.

    ![Find the Display Page Templates menu on the right side Properties menu.](./content-recommendations/images/06.png)

1. Select _Specific Display Page Template_ from the dropdown menu.
1. Click _Select_.  
1. Click on the desired template (for example, the newly created _Recommended WC Template_).
1. Expand the _Metadata_ section in the right menu.
1. Assign tags that characterize the content. These are the tags that are referenced as interests when a user views the content.

    ![Assign the metadata tags. Users can always create more tags as needed.](./content-recommendations/images/07.png)

1. Click _Publish_ when finished.

Now your web content is mapped to a Display Page, which allows the assigned tags to be tracked as interests when the web content is clicked. You can alter this process based on the asset types you want to recommend.

## Assigning Tag using SEO

You can also assign tags to a Page's SEO configuration; the tags would then be assigned to users as interests when they visit the Page.

1. Navigate to _Site Administration_ &rarr; _Site Builder_ &rarr; _Pages_.
1. Click the _Actions_ button (![Actions](../../../images/icon-actions.png)) &rarr; _Configure_ for a Page you want to add tags to.

    ![Configure the page with SEO.](./content-recommendations/images/08.png)

1. On the _General_ menu, under _Categorization_, add relevant tags to the page.

    ![Add the tags to the page.](./content-recommendations/images/09.png)

1. Click _Save_.

Tags have been added to the page and to the web content article. These interests are assessed when recommending content.

## Displaying Content Based on User Behavior

Now that your Site's users' have their interests tracked using tags, create an Asset Publisher to display the content based on their behavior.

1. Navigate to the _Site Administration_ &rarr; _Content & Data_ &rarr; _Collections_.

    ![Navigate to the Collections menu.](./content-recommendations/images/10.png)

1. Click the _Add_ button (![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) &rarr; _Dynamic Selection_.
1. Enter a name (_Sports Recommendations_.)
1. Click _Save_.

    For more information on Collections, see [Creating Collections](../../../content-authoring-and-management/collections/user_guide.rst).

1. Add an [Asset Publisher](../using-the-asset-publisher-widget/selecting-assets-for-the-asset-publisher.md) widget to a Page.
1. Navigate to its _Options_ (![Options](../../../images/icon-app-options.png)) &rarr; _Configuration_ menu.
1. Click the _Collection_ radio button.
1. Expand the _Select Collection_ section and click the _Select_ button.
1. Choose the desired Collection.

    ![Select the collection in the Asset Publisher.](./content-recommendations/images/12.png)

1. Click _Save_ when finished.
1. Click _Publish_ to apply the changes to the site page.

In a realistic scenario, Content Sets have many assets with differing tags. That way, content similar to a user's interests is displayed over other content.

Now when users have accumulated interests based on views, the Asset Publisher only shows content based on their interests.
