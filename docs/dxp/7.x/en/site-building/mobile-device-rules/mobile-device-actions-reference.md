# Mobile Device Actions Reference

Mobile Device Actions defined for a [Mobile Device Family](./creating-mobile-device-rules.md) determine what happens to a request when the device is detected and the family has been found to apply.

Mobile Device Actions can be added to a Site or an individual Page. To add a Mobile Device Action, navigate to the *Site Administration* &rarr; *Site Builder* &rarr; *Pages* menu. Select the desired Site or Page where the Mobile Device Action is to be added. (In this example, we are adding the Mobile Device Action site-wide. Click the (![Gear icon](../../images/icon-cog.png)) icon next to *Public Pages*. The Mobile Device Rules section is found on the *Advanced* tab.)

By default, there are four kinds of actions that can be configured for mobile families:

| Mobile Device Action | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Layout Template Modification** | Changes the way portlets are arranged on pages delivered to mobile devices. For example, you could have pages with more complex layouts automatically switch to a simpler template if it detects a mobile device---even if the resolution is theoretically high enough to support the standard layout. |
| **Theme Modification** | Selects a specific theme for different mobile device families. You'd have to have a mobile version of your Site's theme that is automatically applied when a device hits your page. |
| **URL Redirect** | Sends mobile users to any URL. This can be used to direct mobile users to a mobile app download or a mobile version of the page. |
| **Site Redirect** | Sends mobile users to a different Site on your portal. In some cases, mobile content could be created on a mirror of your Site. |

```tip::
   DXP was designed from the ground up to be responsive and adapt to any device that might be accessing it. Before creating new themes or forcing a layout template change, you should test how the Site behaves using DXP out of the box. Certain features, like URL Redirects, can be disruptive and frustrating for users if used improperly.
