# Exporting and Importing Forms

You can export all your forms as a `LAR` file and then import them into a different site. This way, you can save time and resources by not having to recreate your all your Forms whenever you create a new site.

See [Importing and Exporting Pages and Content](../../../site-building/building-sites/importing-exporting-pages-and-content.md) to learn about the Import/Export process.

## Exporting Forms as a LAR File

To export your forms as a `LAR` file:

1. Navigate to _Site Administration_ &rarr; _Content and Data_  &rarr; _Forms_.
1. Click the ![Options](../../../images/icon-options.png) icon in the upper right then _Export / Import_.
1. Enter a different name for the `LAR` file.
1. Select the desired configuration and content:

    * **Configuration**: Checked
    * **Content**: All
    * **Deletions**: Unchecked
