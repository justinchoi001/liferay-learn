# Introduction to Using Liferay DXP as a Headless Platform

Liferay DXP provides a rich interface out of the box to interact with its features. However, there are many use cases where it's necessary to interact with Liferay DXP outside of this interface, e.g. in writing mobile applications, custom web applications, or automated processes. Liferay DXP's headless functionality provides the means to achieve this. By exposing web APIs, Liferay DXP allows custom programs to perform the same actions as can be done by a user using the web interface. Such client programs can take whatever form is convenient for the implementer, providing the same power as the web interface but with much more flexibility.

There are three different approaches available for clients to connect to Liferay DXP via web API:
* __Headless REST APIs__, conforming to the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/)
* The __GraphQL API__ conforming to the [GraphQL specification](https://graphql.github.io/graphql-spec/June2018/)
* __Plain Web/REST Services__, generated by Service Builder

## Headless REST APIs

Liferay DXP's headless APIs allow [RESTful](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/NOTE-ws-arch-20040211/#relwwwrest) interaction with Liferay DXP resources. These APIs follow the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/), which defines a standard for REST interfaces, allowing for more straightforward implementation and consumption.

Detailed information on these APIs can be found by accessing the definitions on a running Liferay DXP instance at `[server][:port]/o/api` or exploring their documentation on [SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/liferayinc/).

## GraphQL API

The GraphQL API is accessed using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), a query language that supports interactions similar to the headless REST APIs, but with slightly more flexibility.

Detailed information on this API can be found by exploring the API itself or its documentation through a GraphQL client. Liferay DXP includes a built-in client that can be found on a running Liferay DXP instance at `[server][:port]/o/api` (select "GraphQL" on the top-right). [External clients](https://graphql.org/graphql-js/graphql-clients/) can also be used, targeting `[server][:port]/o/graphql`.

## Plain Web/REST Services

Liferay DXP's Web Services are part of an older framework, still supported by DXP but no longer recommended for complex headless operations. These APIs are closely tied to Liferay DXP's internal workings and thus lack the power and flexibility that the newer headless options provide.

However, Web Services may provide a simpler way to execute certain tasks. See [Service Builder Web Services](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017887112-Service-Builder-Web-Services) for how to use them.
